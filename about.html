        <h2>About essellay</h2>
        <p><strong>We turn AWS Service-Level Agreements into real dollars—automatically.</strong><br>
        AWS promises up to 100&nbsp;% service credits when their uptime slips, yet most teams leave that money unclaimed because the process requires manual data collection, complex calculations, and strict deadlines. essellay.ai (pronounced "S-L-A") removes the friction:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Select your AWS services.</strong> We show you exactly which CloudWatch metrics to export for each of our six supported services.</li>
            <li><strong>Upload the CSV files.</strong> Our browser-based engine processes CloudWatch exports and calculates availability against official SLA thresholds.</li>
            <li><strong>Get your claim ready.</strong> We generate the AWS Support request with calculated percentages and credit amounts, plus create a ZIP file with all evidence.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why we built this</h3>
        <p>Every AWS SLA includes the same requirement:</p>
        <blockquote>"Open a Support case within two billing cycles and include timestamps and logs."</blockquote>
        <p>Extracting metrics from CloudWatch, calculating error rates, and mapping to credit tiers takes hours. We automate these calculations so you can focus on building instead of parsing spreadsheets.</p>

        <h3>Your data stays private</h3>
        <table class="instruction-table" style="margin-top:0.5em">
            <tr><th>Security</th><th>What this means</th></tr>
            <tr><td>No AWS credentials</td><td>We never ask for access keys, IAM roles, or account permissions.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Client-side processing</td><td>CSV files are processed entirely in your browser and never uploaded to our servers.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Open calculations</td><td>Our availability formulas match official AWS SLA documents and can be audited.</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h3>What's next</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add support for more AWS services beyond our current six (EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, etc.).</li>
            <li>Detect hidden outages that don't appear in AWS standard metrics or status pages.</li>
            <li>Autofile credits and right-size resources, continuously.</li>
        </ul>
